# text_to_image

A Python project that converts text descriptions into images using deep learning models. This repository demonstrates how to generate images from textual prompts, leveraging state-of-the-art text-to-image models.

## Description

The **text_to_image** project provides tools and scripts to transform natural language text into visually representative images. It showcases the use of pre-trained or custom-trained models (such as diffusion models or GANs) to interpret text prompts and generate corresponding images. This project is ideal for exploring AI creativity, building prototypes, or learning about the intersection of NLP and computer vision.

## Features

- Convert any text description into an image
- Support for popular text-to-image deep learning models
- Easy-to-use script and modular codebase
- Customizable for your own models or datasets
- Example prompts and output images

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3
- **Libraries:** PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on model), Transformers, Pillow, NumPy
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook (for experiments)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shriom-19/text_to_image.git
    cd text_to_image
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(If `requirements.txt` is missing, install the main libraries manually.)*

3. **Download or specify your model/checkpoints as described in the code or notebooks.**

### Usage

- Run the provided script or notebook:
    ```bash
    python generate_image.py --prompt "A sunset over a mountain range"
    ```
- Or open the Jupyter notebook and try different text prompts.

## Example

**Input Prompt:**  
"A red bicycle parked beside a yellow wall on a sunny day."

**Output:**  
*(Generated image will be saved or displayed as specified in the script.)*
